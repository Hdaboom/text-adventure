        <p>You swing your fist in an arc pulling all your weight into to it and connecting with a squelchy hit of a sound and then your fist is slowed to a stop and you feel your fist burning, no thats not right your 
        fist shouldn't be burning, but as you pull your fist back and look down you see your skin is bright red and layers are peeling off and it stings with pain as you look down at it.
        You know you won't be trying that again</p>
        <br>
        <p>What do you do?</p>
