        <p>As you run, trees become a blur and you skid on your hands and knees as you turn down the path and you find yourself at a crossroads,
            to the left there are harsh thorny vines covering the trees, they will be tough to traverse but maybe they could slow the creature down;
            to the right, you see the path snake up into a mountain just maybe the rocky geography could slow the creature down as well, bu which will slow it more
