        <p>Paralysed by choice the creature catches up to you at the crossroads and you see it for what it really is,
            a giant block of gelatinous slime, that could suffocate you and as it moves towards you, you try to run but to no avail as 
            it is surprisingly agile for its size and you are subsumed and you feel your skin burn as you are digested and not a bone remains of you.
